# Model_Checker
The aim of this project is to develop a model checker suitable for teaching software engineering. 
The application is currently a prototype for this model checker and contains some initial features. 
The prototype uses features of the [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) library. Therefore this library and its diagram extension must be installed in order to run the application. In addition the application uses the [pytl](https://github.com/fpom/pytl) Parser to parse CTL formlas.

The prototype currently supports the import of state machine diagrams in an XML format. In the examples folder you can find state machine diagrams that were constructed using [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) and exported as XML files.
